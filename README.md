# Summary

UD_Abkhaz-AbNC is a treebank based on texts from the Abkhaz National Corpus, [AbNC](https://clarino.uib.no/abnc).

# Introduction

UD_Abkhaz-AbNC is a treebank based on texts from the Abkhaz National Corpus, [AbNC](https://clarino.uib.no/abnc), which is a corpus of written texts from a variety of genres. The sentences are taken from a collection of fairy tales for children (Аҧсуа лакәқәа – Ахәыҷқәа рзы, editor: Мықәба, А.) and a short novel by Валентин Дбар.

The sentences are analysed using a finite state morphological analyser, and Constraint Grammar rules for disambiguation and dependency parsing. Both disambiguation and dependency analyses are corrected manually in a tool specifically developed for that purpose.

# Acknowledgments

The Abkhaz treebank and the tools used to create it have been developed by Paul Meurer.

I am grateful to Saida Adzhindzhal (Suchum) for helping me understanding some of the constructions in the texts.
